description: Known for her tightly plotted mysteries, American author Mary Roberts
  Rinehart hits it out of the park with The Breaking Point. A gem from the golden
  era of detective fiction, the novel follows seemingly timid protagonist Elizabeth
  Wheeler, whose placid existence is thrown into disarray by a murder. Forced into
  the role of detective, Elizabeth tries to set things right again. Dive into The
  Breaking Point for an enthralling whodunit.
